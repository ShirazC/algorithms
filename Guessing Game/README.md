This program runs a guessing game using a recursive or iterative implementation.

Usage: run `make` in the command line and then call `./guessingGame` with the following commands:

* `./guessingGame -r [upper bound] [lower bound]`: This runs the guessing game using the recursive implementation. The program will choose a random number in between the given upper and lower bound and you will have to guess the number.
* `./guessingGame -i [upper bound] [lower bound]`: This runs the guessing game using the iterative implementation. The program will choose a random number in between the given upper and lower bound and you will have to guess the number.

To clean your directory, run `make clean`. This will remove all object and executable files from your directory.
