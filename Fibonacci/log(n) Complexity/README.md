This program computes the nth fibonacci number using an algorithm that has log(n) complexity.

Usage: run `make` in the command line and then call `./fibLog [n]`. The program will compute the [n]th fibonacci number using an algorithm that has log(n) complexity.

To clean your directory, run `make clean`. This will remove all object and executable files from your directory.
